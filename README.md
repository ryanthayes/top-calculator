![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)

### Features

- A Simple Calculator which is built with Modern Javascript practices  
- It can evaluate expressions for Multiplication, Division, Subtraction & Addition 
- Clean UI for better visuals
- Responsive for both Desktop & Mobile

### Outcome

* Used HTML5 **semantic elements** for better readability and structure
* Used CSS3 **grid** and **flex** to manage layout
* Used **Data-Attributes** for accessing DOM Elements
* Used **Git** and **GitHub** for project management
* Tried to maintain **clean code**
* **Cross tested** on Firefox and Chromium based browsers

### What I learned

- How to **convert a string to an integer** with **parseFloat**.
- How to select elements on the DOM via **DATA-ATTRIBUTES** to separate from styling with classes.
- How to add **keyboard support** with event listeners (including **preventDefault()** to bypass Quick Look on Firefox from opening when using **'/"**)
